                  <p class="text-muted">It is a new field in machine learning research, and its concept is derived from the study of neural networks. In the field of computer vision, image processing and other fields have great potential for development. Deep learning methods are used to simulate how the human brain thinks, mimicking the mechanisms of the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and text. Taking images as an example, by combining low-level image features, the concepts of intermediate edges, shapes, and the like are developed, and then higher-level meanings, such as objects or faces, are learned.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">Machine learning has evolved very rapidly, with good results in both computer vision and natural language processing. There are many deep learning techniques that are used in everyday life of humans such as autonomous vehicles and face recognition systems. Nowadays, the gradual dependence of human daily life on deep neural networks can lead to serious consequences, so the security of neural networks becomes very important. Therefore, the deep neural network has obvious weaknesses. We propose a method based on generating a confrontation network to generate a facial makeup picture that can deceive the face recognition system. We hide the perturbation of the attack in the results of the abnormal makeup photos that humans can&rsquo;t detect. The experimental results show that we can not only generate high-quality facial makeup images, but also our attack results have a high attack success rate in the face recognition system.</p>

However, this is a serious challenge because the input graffiti can be very messy and hide multiple objects, so finding the correlation between these repeated lines and multiple objects is not a simple matter. In the system, we use selective search, sparse coding and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in which we use selective search to find the part of the object that may be the object of the graffiti; then use sparse coding to find the corresponding element; CNN sets the style to be converted. The final experimental results show that the methods we use have superior performance and produce artistic works.</p>

                  <p class="text-muted">With the popularity of wearable devices in recent years, the application of motion recognition through the sensing it collects has become more and more important. In the field of computer vision, human motion recognition is becoming more and more important. In motion recognition, a large number of sensing data collected by multi-axis wear devices are also used to perform motion recognition. Deep learning is seen as the most promising way to solve many computer vision problems in machine learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most concerned methods in deep learning. We propose the architecture of MP-CNN, which contains two new components of D-CNN and S-CNN to identify the motion data. In D-CNN, we use GMM to get each in the training phase. The distribution of actions, then the GLR and GMMs are used to partition the input signal data and channel calibration, and each input information is mapped to the corresponding CNN channel. Therefore, we also propose an LZW-based S-CNN architecture that uses CNN to construct the relationship between state, input information and transition probability to automatically convert the sensed data to state transition probability. Finally, D-CNN and S-CNN are combined into MP-CNN to improve the overall architecture performance.</p>
